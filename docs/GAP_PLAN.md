# rvoip — Gap Plan (outstanding work)

**v1 surface closed 2026-05-26.** All `[V1]` gap rows and phases P1–P12 landed,
and the v2.A + v2.B architectural round shipped (carve `rvoip-core-traits` to
break the dep cycle; per-tenant `Semaphore` admission). All workspace lib tests
pass.

This document was trimmed (2026-06-01) to track **only what remains**. The full
phase-by-phase implementation history (P1–P12, v2.A/v2.B, the gap inventory, and
the original roadmap) is in git history — `git log --follow docs/GAP_PLAN.md`.

Spec references point into the sibling design docs:
[`INTERFACE_DESIGN.md`](INTERFACE_DESIGN.md), [`PRD.md`](PRD.md),
[`CONVERSATION_PROTOCOL.md`](CONVERSATION_PROTOCOL.md).

## Outstanding `[V1.x]` items

No tracked V1.x implementation gap from the June 2026 roadmap remains open in
the current tree.

## Recently closed `[V1.x]` items

| # | Item | Status / next step | Spec source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3.O.8 (follow-up) | WebRTC DTMF (RFC 4733) decode | Closed: `rvoip-webrtc` decodes PT-101 telephone-event frames on receive, emits `AdapterEvent::Dtmf`, and suppresses those packets from ordinary audio forwarding. | CONVERSATION_PROTOCOL §7.5, §10.3 |
| 3.O.9 | Inline envelope signatures enforced at adapter boundary | Closed: QUIC, WebTransport, and WebSocket substrate adapters expose optional `Sig9421Config`; default remains disabled for compatibility. | CONVERSATION_PROTOCOL §5.5.1 |
| 3.O.10 | `rvoip-vcon-postgres` reference store | Closed: optional `rvoip-vcon-postgres` crate ships typed `rvoip_vcon::VconStore`, SQL migration, content hashes, and an optional byte-store bridge for `rvoip_core::store::VconStore`. | INTERFACE_DESIGN §11.5 |

## Deferred backlog (per design docs — no work proposed yet)

Tracked for visibility only. When one is taken up, add a phase to this doc.

| Item | Label | Spec source |
|---|---|---|
| AAuth production hardening (gated `aauth-experimental`; the validator already landed) | `[V1.x]` | INTERFACE_DESIGN §2.4, §8.5 |
| RFC 9421 default-on per-request signing | `[V1.x]` | INTERFACE_DESIGN §2.4 |
| DTLS-SRTP fingerprint binding default-on | `[V1.x]` | INTERFACE_DESIGN §8.4 |
| `conversation.update` for policy change | `[V1.x]` | CONVERSATION_PROTOCOL §7.1 |
| Multi-party UCTP beyond N=2 via SFU adapter | `[V2]` | PRD §5; INTERFACE_DESIGN §2.4 |
| SIP-over-QUIC / RoQ / MoQ adapters | `[V2]` | INTERFACE_DESIGN §2.5 |
| Lyra V2 over UCTP and SIP/RTP, with a Lyra-over-RoQ end-to-end proof | `[V2]` | [`../ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md#lyra-v2--rtp-over-quic-workstream); INTERFACE_DESIGN §2.5 |

> The earlier `rvoip-websocket` `[V1.x]` deferral is **closed** — the substrate
> shipped at `crates/uctp/rvoip-websocket`.

## Resolved design questions

The four v1 open questions were all decided as-shipped, and are recorded here so
they're not re-opened:

1. **`rvoip-harness` spin-off** — spun off as a separate crate (the seam was the point).
2. **`rvoip-identity` spin-off** — shipped as a separate crate with a no-op `BearerProvider`; the `IdentityProvider` trait stays in `rvoip-core::identity`.
3. **Tenant scoping** — P6 landed multi-tenant data isolation per process (registries + per-tenant quota).
4. **vCon production wiring** — P3 emits validated unsigned vCons by default. `rvoip-vcon` exposes opt-in JWS General JSON signing and signature appending; automatic tenant-key selection is not wired, and JWE is absent. Production key policy and confidentiality remain `[V1.x]` roadmap items.
