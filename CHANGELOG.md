## Unreleased

## 0.3.8 — 2026-08-14

This coordinated 44-crate patch release brings AMR-NB and AMR-WB into the
codec set end to end — negotiation, transport, transcoding, and release
evidence — adds record-routed proxy interop to the qualification matrix, and
repairs SIPS dialog and opus-bridge edge cases found on the way.

### AMR codecs

- Add AMR-NB and AMR-WB with IF1 and IF2 interface formats, VAD1/VAD2 and DTX
  reaching the wire, receive-side interleaving reassembly, max-red redundancy
  scheduling with dedup, and CMR damping — bit-exact against the fetched
  TS 26.073/26.101/26.201 material, with no 3GPP sources in the repository.
- Negotiate and obey the SDP mode-set, prove every mode in a live call, and
  attest each rate in the release evidence; long-run soaks cover both
  variants.
- Admit dynamic codecs into the media graph by their negotiated payload type
  (`CodecInfo` now carries it), re-frame packet times AMR cannot accept
  (10 ms joins and 30 ms splits), and label emitted frames so the UCTP pumps
  stop stamping Opus's number on everything else.
- Prove AMR crosses SRTP in process and a QUIC datagram in both directions.

### SIP, proxies, and interop

- Generate a secure fallback Contact for every RFC 3261 §12.1.1 trigger, so
  secure dialogs answer with `sips:` at the TLS-advertised address while
  explicit Contact and plain-SIP behavior are preserved (issue #176). This
  also repairs rvoip-to-rvoip SIPS setup: `Dialog::from_2xx_response` refuses
  a secure dialog whose Contact is not `sips:`, which the old plain fallback
  tripped.
- Learn the UAC route set from the dialog-forming 2xx's Record-Route
  (reversed per §12.1.2), so in-dialog requests stop bypassing
  record-routing proxies; the UAS side reads it from the request.
- Add Kamailio and OpenSIPS registrar-proxy labs with TLS and SRTP through
  rtpengine, opt-in AMR-NB transcoding (the AMR-WB transcode failure is
  attributed to rtpengine), and a per-rate sweep bound to the gate catalog.
- Expose the profiled egress registration's coordinator for
  observation-only event subscriptions; the composite adapter remains the
  sole signaling and lifecycle owner.
- `Config` gains `with_amr_dtx`, `with_amr_auto_cmr`, and
  `with_amr_mode_set` builders (private fields — `Config`'s constructible
  shape stays frozen). DTX and auto-CMR are local media policy; only the
  RFC 4867 `mode-set` is negotiated.
- `CodecInfo` carries the payload type a transport negotiated
  (`payload_type: Option<u8>`). Code constructing `CodecInfo` literals adds
  one field on upgrade; `None` preserves the name-table behavior.

### Media graph and bridges

- Keep opus↔opus bridges passthrough when the two legs numbered opus
  differently: the payload type is a per-leg SDP artifact, so the bypass
  compares name, rate, and channels, and passthrough restamps the sink's
  payload type on egress.
- Make a barge-in flush empty the re-framing accumulator as well as the sink
  queues, so no pre-interruption audio or dead-timeline timestamp survives
  into the first post-flush frame.
- Reach the opus and all-codecs feature sets from the rvoip facade.

### Qualification

`0.3.8` requires a fresh `remote-release` qualification bound to the updated
gate catalog, which adds the AMR per-rate sweep, the proxy-PBX media family,
and the AMR fuzz targets. Because the aggregate is bound to the catalog hash,
no `0.3.7` evidence qualifies this release.

## 0.3.7 — 2026-08-06

This coordinated 44-crate patch release hardens voice-AI and WebRTC media under
backpressure, exposes inbound SIP auth/context on the app facade, and repairs
SIP/WebRTC edge cases that dropped audio, DTMF, or late tracks.

### Vapi and media reliability

- Bound inbound/outbound audio queues so bursts and uplink stalls no longer kill
  the session; keep the RTP clock advancing across underruns and re-converge
  jitter depth on renegotiation.
- Adaptive jitter target, working inbound catch-up, and a symmetric outbound
  drain valve; flush stale playout audio on barge-in.
- Move WebSocket writes off the media loop, isolate control from media
  backpressure, and attribute media logs and health telemetry per call
  (`VapiMediaHealth`, current depth vs high-water, catch-up blocked ticks).

### WebRTC, Connect, and SIP

- Preserve media and unbind under driver backpressure; tolerate WebRTC startup
  backpressure without evicting Connect media routes or sinks.
- Allow primary audio and DTMF when a peer never negotiates MID; attach late
  remote audio tracks; bound per-peer UDP allocation; preserve remote codec
  preference order.
- Route wildcard contacts via the observed source address.
- Surface listener auth and inbound context policy on `SipConfig`
  (`tenant`, `trusted_trunk`, `capture_headers`) so facade apps can do
  DID-based routing and trunk admission.

### Release and workspace

- Publish the exact qualified candidate, keep qualification checkout on `main`,
  and allow signed ancestor release publication when attestation requires it.
- Inherit remaining third-party and `rtc` dependency pins from the workspace so
  version bumps stay single-source.

### Qualification

`0.3.7` requires a fresh, source-bound strict full-beta PASS. Historical
`0.3.2` exception, `0.3.4` carry-forward, and prior `0.3.6` qualification
evidence do not qualify it.

## 0.3.6 — 2026-08-02

This coordinated 44-crate patch release moves full release qualification onto
ephemeral GCP workers, repairs remote gate false failures, and lands SIP/core
correctness fixes needed for reliable attestation.

### Release qualification

- Run complete release qualification on ephemeral GCP workers with parallel
  performance, soak, proxy-interop, and diagnostic profiles.
- Cache exact performance build bundles, stream large artifacts from disk, and
  reuse selective evidence only when digests match.
- Reject failed candidates before deferred gates finish; accelerate long soaks;
  harden burst RSS and FreeSWITCH/PBX readiness checks.
- Automate active release metadata updates in `README.md`,
  `BETA_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`, and `RELEASE_NOTES_NEXT.md`.

### SIP, core, and security dependencies

- Publish the established event only after ACK; consume non-2xx ACK at the write
  boundary; tolerate legal final-response retransmission in soak evidence.
- Preserve cross-crate event semantics and make filtered message pagination
  deterministic.
- Send browser DTMF on the negotiated audio source.
- Upgrade jsonwebtoken, OpenTelemetry, and SIP terminal UI dependencies; remove
  the legacy AWS rustls adapter.

### Qualification

`0.3.6` requires a fresh, source-bound strict full-beta PASS. Historical
`0.3.2` exception and `0.3.4` carry-forward evidence do not qualify it.

## 0.3.5 — 2026-07-30

This coordinated 44-crate patch release hardens security and media state,
completes transactional SIP renegotiation, exposes symmetric-RTP NAT policy on
the high-level APIs, and makes Tokio the sole WebRTC runtime.

### Security and media

- Fail closed for placeholder AES-GCM profiles and unsupported DTLS
  construction; incomplete profiles cannot be advertised or negotiated.
- Correct RTP padding and RFC 8285 extensions, RTCP LSR/compound parsing, and
  loss/jitter accounting across rollover, gaps, duplicates, and reordering.
- Separate inbound/outbound and per-SSRC SRTP/SRTCP state, authenticate before
  committing replay state, and cover the result with RFC vectors and pinned
  libSRTP interoperability.
- Generate directional SDES answer keys and accept safely unpadded AES-256 key
  material in compatible mode with secret-safe diagnostics (issue #46).
- Preserve the 0.3.x `Config`, `Event`, `SessionError`, state-table, and
  negotiated-media shapes while exposing new auth, SDES, and renegotiation
  details through bounded additive diagnostic/runtime APIs.

### SIP, codecs, and WebRTC

- Make hold/resume, re-INVITE, UPDATE, delayed offers, authentication retries,
  retransmissions, rollback, and media application transactional and
  exact-generation owned.
- Expose `SipNatConfig` and `SymmetricRtpPolicy` through `EndpointBuilder` and
  `StreamPeerBuilder` (issue #50).
- Use the real Opus backend, make codec names ASCII case-insensitive, and stop
  advertising unavailable Opus or G.722 implementations.
- Remove Smol/async-std runtime support from WebRTC and correct the confirmed
  Chromium audio/SSRC/simulcast SDP regression.
- Preserve bounded, sharded, keyed/no-scan SIP lifecycle paths and make the
  registrar and coordinated workspace pass strict release linting.

### Qualification

`0.3.5` requires a fresh, source-bound strict full-beta PASS. Historical
`0.3.2` exception and `0.3.4` carry-forward evidence do not qualify it.

## 0.3.4 — 2026-07-29

This coordinated 44-crate patch release adds exact inbound-admission terminal
notification, completes RFC 6026 INVITE Accepted lifecycles, and introduces a
bounded RFC 3261 transaction-stateful proxy profile updated by RFC 4320 and
RFC 6026.

### Added

- Exact-generation inbound admission termination notification for cancelled,
  remotely ended, and failed source legs without polling.
- Compact, sharded Timer M/L retention driven by the existing manager-owned
  deadline queues rather than per-transaction runners and sleeper tasks.
- Matched/unmatched proxy CANCEL handling, fork response contexts, multiple
  and late 2xx forwarding, ACK ownership, Timer C, response aggregation, and
  strict/loose routing coverage within the documented bounded profile.
- Fail-closed Kamailio/OpenSIPS interoperability and four-peer beta-report
  attestation tooling for future strict full-beta runs.
- `rvoip-release-carry-forward-attestation-v1` release verification.

### Fixed

- Atomic, generation-protected transaction timer firing removes a saturated
  command-channel race that could strand expired transactions.
- Accepted transactions shed active runners, transports, command queues, and
  active-only locks while preserving RFC retention and exact cleanup.
- INVITE retransmission, late response, Via/route, RFC 3263 failover, and
  stateful-proxy response behavior have focused regression coverage.

### Qualification

The owner approved `0.3.4` with a transparent carry-forward disposition. The
full `0.3.4` beta, four-peer interoperability matrix, and long soaks were not
rerun. Current evidence is the complete workspace release verification and one
clean revision-bound canonical 2,000-CPS/65,000-call real-media PASS. The
immutable `0.3.2` owner-approved exception remains historical background with
strict status `NON-RC` and is not relabeled as a current beta PASS.

## 0.3.3 — 2026-07-29

This unified patch release corrects the vCon wire model, Session-finalization
path, signatures, content hashes, stores, and documentation against
`draft-ietf-vcon-vcon-core` commit
`2342aba64bdb71d9e80ab6e274a3921e2b1c769e`.

### Fixed

- End-of-Session emission now converts snapshots into the canonical
  `rvoip-vcon` model, validates them, serializes with serde, and suppresses
  persistence/`VconReady` on conversion, validation, or serialization failure.
  Inline dialog, analysis, and attachment bodies are preserved as Base64Url.
- The container now uses vCon `0.4.0`, durations in seconds, required analysis
  vendor/encoding data, attachment placement and purpose fields, URL/hash
  dependencies, complete dialog/party fields, and mutually exclusive
  redacted/amended lineage.
- vCon signatures now use JWS General JSON Serialization with appendable
  signatures and certificate references. Compact JWT serialization is no
  longer emitted as a signed vCon.
- New store handles use the specified
  `sha512-<unpadded-base64url-digest>` content hash in memory and PostgreSQL.
  The typed `VconStore` contract exposes the stored content hash, and identical
  canonical documents hash identically across memory and PostgreSQL. Existing
  persisted legacy hashes are not rewritten.
- Federation documentation no longer assigns semantics to reserved core
  `group`; sibling-vCon grouping is deferred to a future named extension
  declared in `extensions[]`.
- Documentation now states the shipped security boundary: core emission is
  unsigned, JWS signing is explicit, JWE is absent, and lineage types do not
  perform redaction.

### Added

- Canonical draft example/schema conformance coverage and a dedicated vCon CI
  job, including live PostgreSQL store tests and affected integration
  boundaries.
- Hash- and commit-bound `--targeted-delta-attestation` release verification.
  It retains unified manifest, workspace compile, and package checks while
  honestly recording that broad beta/workspace test/doc suites were not
  rerun. The approved targeted matrix is rerun and live PostgreSQL evidence is
  machine-verified.

### Breaking vCon changes

- `sign_jws` now accepts a certificate reference and returns `SignedVcon`;
  `append_signature` adds another signer, and verification accepts the General
  JSON form. HMAC algorithms are rejected for this certificate-bound API.
- Dialog `duration_ms` becomes `duration` in seconds. The model adds the
  standard party, dialog, analysis, attachment, extension, and critical
  fields. The undeclared Party `role` field is removed; the core `type` field
  classifies parties (for example, `person`, `bot`, or `organization`), while
  role semantics require a declared extension.
- `redacted: Vec<RedactionRecord>` becomes one optional `Redacted` object and
  gains the mutually exclusive optional `Amended` object.
- Core vCon analysis vendors and attachment placement become required;
  attachment `note` becomes `purpose`; party `did_or_stir` splits into `did`
  and `stir`; and snapshot encoding is fallible. The core byte-store `put`
  contract now also receives `ConversationId` and exposes
  `list_for_conversation` so sibling vCons are linked in index metadata rather
  than through the reserved `group` parameter.

## 0.3.2 — 2026-07-29

This unified release advances the reusable Bridgefu 1.0 foundation across all
44 publishable workspace crates.

### Added

- Hash-bound release-exception reporting for the owner-approved 0.3.2
  candidate, with the strict 106/108 gate result and NON-RC qualification
  preserved rather than rewritten.
- Complete authenticated-principal propagation and ownership checks across
  SIP, WebRTC, UCTP, routes, and operational events.
- Transport-neutral `DataMessage`, arbitrary WebRTC DataChannels, SIP MESSAGE,
  typed initial SIP headers, DTMF, and correlated transfer outcomes.
- Single-consumer `MediaGraph` with directional routes, codec-group
  transcoding, bounded fanout, snapshots, drops/evictions, and metrics.
- Dormant prepare/bind/activate lifecycles for SIP, WebRTC, and Amazon Connect,
  including owned cancellation, terminal events, and bounded drain.
- SIP outbound activation receipts now linearize after the exact session is
  active. Established teardown waits for the peer's successful final BYE
  response while still reclaiming local state on timeout or rejection.
- UCTP 0.2 complete-RTP routing, authenticated raw QUIC/WebTransport sessions,
  virtual publishers, direct-listener limits, and exact cleanup.
- `rvoip-moq` draft-19/MSF-01/LOC-03 publisher, subscriber, origin, relay,
  authorization, compatibility, reconnect, health, and drain abstractions.
- Configurable symmetric RTP, advertised SIP/RTP addresses, RFC 3581 `rport`,
  WebRTC ICE server/NAT policy, and per-exchange WHIP/WHEP versus WS gathering.
- Developer-preview `rvoip-vapi` bidirectional WebSocket agent adapter, exposed
  by the facade's opt-in `vapi` feature and included in `full`.
- High-level `rvoip::app` voice-only admission for SIP or WebRTC customers,
  including transport-neutral accepted-call events, startup-safe event
  retention, explicit SIP/RTP advertisement, and example 14's shared Vapi
  agent server.

### Fixed

- SCIM provisioning now generates policy-safe bootstrap passwords without
  random failures from repeated/sequential characters or username overlap.

### Breaking protocol changes

- UCTP media datagrams now carry a complete RTP packet after the UCTP header.
- Wire-incompatible MOQT draft changes are semver-breaking at the
  `rvoip-moq` compatibility boundary.
- `rvoip_core_traits::connection::Transport` adds the `Vapi` variant; downstream
  exhaustive matches over this public enum must add a corresponding arm.
- `rvoip::app::AppEvent` adds the `InboundCallAccepted` variant; downstream
  exhaustive matches over this public enum must add a corresponding arm.

The private WebRTC/RTC TURN candidate and the dynamic moq-rs publisher-lease
candidate remain outside the consumed dependency graph until project-owner
review. No upstream submission is authorized by this changelog.
