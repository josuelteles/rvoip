# Contributing to rvoip

Thank you for helping improve rvoip. Contributions of fixes, tests,
documentation, and focused features are welcome.

## Before opening a pull request

1. Open or reference an issue for behavior changes that need design discussion.
2. Keep each pull request focused on one problem.
3. Add or update tests that demonstrate the changed behavior.
4. Run the most relevant local checks you can. The repository's required
   `PR Gate` is the authoritative result and runs automatically on GitHub.
5. Do not include credentials, generated release evidence, media captures, or
   unrelated formatting changes.

You do not need to run the complete release suite on your computer. CI chooses
the directly affected workspace crates, their reverse dependencies, and any
specialty gates declared for the changed paths. It balances that work into no
more than four shards and runs tests and Clippy on the same warm build graph.
Public API changes compile a representative example contract set on the PR;
the Main Gate still tests all 44 crates, doctests, and every standalone
example. Main also runs the deferred long SIP target in its own lane instead
of returning it to a monolithic workspace shard. The large SIP integration inventory is duration-balanced across
bounded PR lanes. Process-based fixtures share one cache-backed lane so their
example binaries are built once, while SIP core tests and Clippy run in
parallel. The ten-minute audio round-trip target runs on Main Gate and release
qualification instead of holding every SIP PR open. Changes to shared or
unmapped build inputs deliberately select the full workspace, while CI-policy-
only changes run the planner and policy tests.

Shards build each crate with its *default* features, so a test that lives
behind an optional feature is compiled out rather than run. Where a crate keeps
substantial test code behind such a feature — the codecs do, since G.729, Opus
and AMR are all optional — a specialty gate repeats the run with
`--all-features`. If you add an optional feature that carries tests, put it
behind a gate; otherwise the tests exist and nothing executes them.

## Pull request expectations

Complete the pull request template, including:

- the problem and the intended behavior;
- the affected crates or subsystems;
- tests added or changed;
- operational, compatibility, or security risks; and
- an issue reference such as `Fixes #123` when applicable.

The `PR Gate` must pass and review conversations must be resolved before a
pull request can merge. External contributors cannot merge their own changes.
Maintainers may request narrower commits, additional tests, or a release note.

Use a clear, imperative title. Apply one primary release-note label:
`feature`, `fix`, `security`, `documentation`, or `breaking-change`.

## Test guidance

Tests should be placed as close as practical to the behavior they protect:

- unit tests for isolated logic and failure handling;
- integration tests for boundaries between crates or services;
- regression tests for a reported bug;
- feature-matrix checks for optional behavior; and
- interoperability or performance gates only when those properties changed.

Avoid tests that depend on public internet services, wall-clock timing, fixed
ports, or shared global state unless the gate catalog explicitly provides that
resource. Never weaken or delete a failing test merely to make CI green.

## Security reports

Do not open public issues for suspected vulnerabilities. Follow
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) instead.
