//! What an AMR-WB decoder does when a frame does not arrive intact.
//!
//! Everything else in this crate reconstructs a frame from its bits. This
//! module reconstructs one from *history*, and it is the only part of the
//! decoder that runs exclusively when something has already gone wrong.
//!
//! # Two kinds of bad, and they are not interchangeable
//!
//! The reference draws a line that is easy to miss and expensive to blur:
//!
//! - **Damaged** ([`FrameQuality::Bad`], the reference's `bfi = 1`,
//!   `unusable_frame = 0`). The payload arrived; a checksum says some of it is
//!   wrong. The parameters that a single flipped bit would ruin — the spectrum,
//!   the gains, the pitch lag — are rebuilt from history, but the algebraic
//!   codebook indices and the LTP filter select bit are still *decoded from the
//!   payload*. A wrong pulse position costs one subframe of noise; a wrong lag
//!   or gain rings for hundreds of milliseconds, so only the latter are worth
//!   discarding. This is what a cleared RTP Q bit means.
//! - **Lost** ([`FrameQuality::Unusable`], `bfi = 1, unusable_frame = 1`).
//!   Nothing usable arrived at all. Now the innovation is white noise from the
//!   decoder's own generator and the LTP low-pass is forced off, because there
//!   are no bits to say otherwise.
//!
//! Treating a damaged frame as lost throws away perfectly good pulses and
//! sounds hollow; treating a lost frame as damaged decodes noise as if it were
//! signal and sounds like a burst of static. Both are audible, neither fails
//! a build, so the distinction is carried explicitly through every entry point
//! here rather than inferred.
//!
//! # The state machine has memory beyond the frame
//!
//! Concealment is not a per-frame function. Three pieces of state outlive the
//! frame that sets them:
//!
//! - a **severity counter** that climbs with each consecutive loss and selects
//!   how hard the gains are attenuated. Wideband *halves* it on a good frame
//!   rather than clearing it, so one clean frame in the middle of a bad patch
//!   does not reset the decoder's opinion of the channel. (Narrowband clears
//!   it. Copying the narrowband rule here mutes the wrong number of frames
//!   after a burst.)
//! - a **lag history** of the last five good subframes, plus their pitch
//!   gains, which together decide whether a received-but-suspect lag is
//!   plausible enough to keep.
//! - **two generators**, one for the substituted innovation and one for the
//!   jitter added to a substituted lag. They are separate in the reference and
//!   must stay separate: sharing one couples the pitch contour to the noise
//!   and drifts the moment either is consumed a different number of times.
