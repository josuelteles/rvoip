//! AMR-WB encoder: the algebraic codebook search and its index packing.
//!
//! Implements, from 3GPP TS 26.173 (the TS 26.190 §6.8 fixed-point definition):
//! `cor_h_x()` (`cor_h_x.c`), `Pit_shrp()` (`pit_shrp.c`), `ACELP_2t64_fx()`
//! (`c2t64fx.c`), `ACELP_4t64_fx()` with its two file-static helpers
//! `cor_h_vec()` and `search_ixiy()` (`c4t64fx.c`), and all seven combinatorial
//! packers of `q_pulse.c`.
//!
//! # Why every comparison here is load-bearing
//!
//! This is a *search*, not a formula. An implementation that picks a
//! different-but-equally-good candidate produces perfectly plausible speech and
//! a different bitstream, so the parts that have to be reproduced exactly are
//! the objective at each nesting level, the comparison operator (`> 0`
//! throughout — strictly greater, so ties keep the *earlier* candidate), the
//! order positions are visited in (ascending sample index, always), and the
//! adaptive candidate set for the outer pulse of each stage. Two arithmetic
//! quirks are part of the decision rather than artefacts of it:
//!
//! * `mult(x, 32767) == x - 1` for `x > 0` (and `== x` for `x <= 0`). The
//!   reference folds pulse signs into the cross-correlation table with
//!   `mult(v, ±32767/−32768)`, so a "positive" sign is not the identity. Turning
//!   it into a sign flip changes which pair wins in near-ties.
//! * `mult(ps, ps)` is an arithmetic `>>15` that floors, so any `|ps| < 182`
//!   collapses the numerator to zero and the candidate can never beat a
//!   positive incumbent.
//!
//! # Validation
//!
//! The committed tests here run at 12.65 kbit/s, which is the rate of the
//! committed trace, and therefore cover the 36-bit budget only. They are
//! bit-exact against the TS 26.173 encoder's own per-subframe trace
//! (`testdata/wb_enc_trace.txt`) for the filtered codeword `y2` and — after the
//! caller's pre-emphasis and pitch sharpening — the codeword `code`, and
//! against the reference encoder's committed bitstream
//! (`testdata/amrwb_enc_mode2.amr`) for the four packed pulse indices of every
//! subframe.
//!
//! The other seven codebooks are covered here by round-tripping the real
//! search's own indices through this crate's already bit-exact decoder at every
//! budget, which pins each pulse's track, position and sign.
//!
//! Offline — with 50-frame traces at every rate from
//! `tools/trace-amrwb-encoder.sh`, which are not committed — the two-pulse
//! search and all seven four-track budgets were checked bit-exact over 200
//! subframes each for `y2`, `code` and the packed indices. Rerun that sweep
//! before trusting any change to the search.

// The reference's variable names are the specification's vocabulary — `k_cn`
// and `k_dn`, `g_pitch` and `g2_pitch` — and renaming them to satisfy the
// similar-names heuristic would make this module harder, not easier, to check
// against TS 26.173. Same exemption the `fixed_point` subtree takes, and for
// the same reason.

// Every packed position is `position (0..15) + 16` when the pulse is negative,

// sign mask from `N` instead is a classic way to break the 4-, 5- and 6-pulse
// packers while leaving the 1- and 2-pulse ones working.
//
// The reference writes these with basic operators, but every intermediate is a
// non-negative value under 2^22 (the widest result, `pack_6p` with N = 4, is 22
// bits) and every shift is by a compile-time constant under 20, so no `add`,
// `shl`, `L_add` or `L_shl` here can saturate. Plain integer arithmetic is
// therefore bit-identical, and the tests assert the width bound on every
// result. Sign handling is `&`, `^` and `%`, which the reference does with
// plain C operators too.
