//! Encoder-side DTX for AMR-WB, TS 26.173 `dtx.c`.
//!
//! # What runs, and how often
//!
//! Discontinuous transmission is not "stop encoding when the VAD says quiet".
//! Every non-speech frame still runs the full front end and still buffers its
//! spectrum and energy; the encoder builds a complete SID payload on *every*
//! frame it marks `MRDTX`, and roughly seven in eight of those are then thrown
//! away by the frame-type layer and sent as `NO_DATA`. The bits of a transmitted
//! SID therefore depend on every discarded frame before it, through
//! its ring of buffered frames, the distance matrix and the noise seed. An
//! implementation that computed the SID lazily — only when one is about to go
//! out — would produce different bits.
//!
//! # The two `dtx_buffer` call sites disagree, deliberately
//!
//! The reference buffers a frame's spectrum and residual energy from two
//! different places, and they do not agree on their inputs:
//!
//! | | on an `MRDTX` frame | on a speech-mode frame the VAD called quiet |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | predictor | the **unquantised** interpolated LP of subframe 4 | the **quantised** per-subframe LP |
//! | `Residu` calls | one, spanning all 256 samples | four, one per subframe |
//! | ISFs | unquantised | quantised, overwritten in place by the quantiser |
//!
//! Both feed the same ring. Factoring them into one helper that "picks the
//! residual" loses the distinction, and the resulting SID is plausible and
//! wrong several frames later. [`DtxEncoder::buffer`] therefore takes the
//! already-computed energy and ISFs, and the two call sites in the encoder
//! compute them separately.
