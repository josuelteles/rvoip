//! Pitch analysis for the AMR-WB encoder, 3GPP TS 26.190 §5.5–5.7.
//!
//! Implements, from the TS 26.173 fixed-point reference: `Hp_wsp` and
//! `scale_mem_Hp_wsp` (`hp_wsp.c`), `Pitch_med_ol`, `median5` and `Med_olag`
//! (`p_med_ol.c`) together with the open-loop driver and adaptive weighting of
//! `cod_main.c` 543–608, the per-subframe lag window of `cod_main.c` 751–765 /
//! 925–998, `Pitch_fr4` with its `Norm_Corr` and `Interpol_4` helpers
//! (`pitch_f4.c`), the long-term-prediction low-pass and its `select` decision
//! (`cod_main.c` 1026–1109), `G_pitch` (`g_pitch.c`), `Convolve`
//! (`convolve.c`), `Updt_tar` (`updt_tar.c`) and the gain-clipping tracker
//! (`gpclip.c`).
//!
//! The pitch *index* encoding of `cod_main.c` 902–1011 is deliberately not
//! here: it turns these outputs into bits, which is the bitstream layer's job.
//!
//! # What validated it
//!
//! `testdata/wb_enc_trace.txt`, produced by driving the TS 26.173 encoder
//! itself at 12.65 kbit/s. The committed tests compare, over its three frames
//! and twelve subframes, the rows `T_op_med`, `T0`, `T0_frac`, `T0_min`,
//! `T0_max`, `adapt`, `y1`, `gain1`, `gain2`, `select` and `cn`, driven from
//! `wsp`, `wsp_shift`, `Q_new`, `xn`, `h1`, `Aq`, `isf_unq46`, `decimated`,
//! `exc_total` and `gain_pit`. Each test states how many subframes it compared,
//! so a harness that silently produced nothing would fail rather than pass.
//!
//! During development the same harness was run against the full 50-frame trace
//! (200 subframes) at 6.60, 8.85, 12.65 and 14.25 kbit/s and agreed on every
//! row, which is what exercises the branches the committed rate does not: the
//! whole-frame open-loop search, the single-absolute-subframe window, the
//! half-sample-only resolution, the absent unfiltered candidate, and the
//! interoperable gain-clipping constants. Only the three committed frames are
//! used by the tests that ship.
//!
//! # Three searches, three tie-breaks
//!
//! Every stage here picks a best candidate, and each picks it a different way.
//! An implementation that maximises the same objective but breaks ties the
//! other way produces speech that sounds fine and fails conformance, so the
//! handedness is spelled out at each site and tested on its own:
//!
//! * open loop — visits lags **descending** and compares non-strictly, so a tie
//!   goes to the **smallest** lag;
//! * closed-loop integer — visits **ascending**, compares non-strictly, so a
//!   tie goes to the **largest** lag;
//! * closed-loop fraction — visits **ascending**, compares **strictly**, so a
//!   tie keeps the incumbent, i.e. the **smallest** fraction.
//!
//! # Q-formats
//!
//! The weighted speech, the pitch target `xn` and the excitation share the
//! frame's scaling: `Q_new` from the pre-emphasis, plus the frame-level `shift`
//! derived from the maximum of `wsp[]`. This module never computes either — it
//! takes signals already in that scaling and states per function what it
//! expects. Gains are Q14, correlations Q15, the impulse response `h1` Q15.
