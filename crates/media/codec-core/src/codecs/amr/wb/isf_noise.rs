//! The comfort-noise ISF quantiser, TS 26.173 `qisf_ns.c`.
//!
//! A SID frame carries 35 bits and spends 28 of them on the spectrum, against
//! the speech quantiser's 46. Two things follow, and both matter more than the
//! bit count:
//!
//! **It is memoryless.** The speech quantiser carries a moving-average
//! predictor across frames (`IsfQuantizer::past`); this one subtracts a
//! constant mean and quantises the remainder. Comfort noise has to decode
//! correctly after an arbitrary gap — the receiver may have heard nothing for
//! seconds — so there is nothing to predict from. A port that reused the
//! speech quantiser's predictor would produce a spectrum that drifts with how
//! much speech preceded the silence.
//!
//! **The mean vector is a different vector.** `MEAN_ISF_NOISE` and the speech
//! quantiser's `MEAN_ISF` are both sixteen `i16` in Q15 and differ in every
//! coefficient. Passing one where the other belongs compiles, and yields a
//! plausible noise spectrum that is wrong everywhere; the generator asserts
//! they share no coefficient for exactly that reason.
//!
//! The search itself is the same shape as the speech refinement stages —
//! exhaustive, ascending, ties to the lower index — so it reuses
//! [`nearest_entry`] rather than restating it.
