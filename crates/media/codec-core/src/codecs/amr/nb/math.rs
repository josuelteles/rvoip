//! AMR-NB's table-driven transcendentals, TS 26.073 `log2.c`, `pow2.c`,
//! `sqrt_l.c` and `inv_sqrt.c`.
//!
//! # Why these are not shared
//!
//! Every fixed-point speech codec in this crate needs `log2`, `2^x` and a
//! square root, and every one of them tabulates those functions over its own
//! points. G.729's live in [`crate::codecs::g729::impls::math`]; AMR-WB's in
//! `wb::math`; these are AMR-NB's. Sharing any pair would give a codec that
//! sounds nearly right and fails conformance, so the tables — and therefore the
//! code that interpolates them — stay with their codec. Only the genuinely
//! table-free arithmetic is shared, in [`crate::fixed_point`].
//!
//! # The common shape
//!
//! All four are the same idea: normalise the input, take some top bits as a
//! table index and the next fifteen as an interpolation fraction, then walk one
//! linear segment between adjacent entries. The tables *are* the function, not
//! an approximation of it — a more accurate logarithm produces different bits
//! and fails conformance.
//!
//! Where they differ is which bits become the index, and that difference is not
//! cosmetic: `log2`, `sqrt` and `inv_sqrt` shift right by nine first because
//! their input is a normalised `Word32`, while `pow2`'s input is a Q15 fraction
//! that is already in position. Sharing one extraction helper across all four
//! would have to smuggle that shift back in.
