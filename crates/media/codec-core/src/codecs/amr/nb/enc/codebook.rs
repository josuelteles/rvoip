//! The AMR-NB encoder's eight algebraic-codebook searches, TS 26.090 §5.8.
//!
//! Implements, from the TS 26.073 fixed-point reference: `cor_h_x`/`cor_h_x2`
//! and `cor_h` (`cor_h.c`), `set_sign` and `set_sign12k2` (`set_sign.c`), the
//! per-rate entry points `code_2i40_9bits` (`c2_9pf.c`), `code_2i40_11bits`
//! (`c2_11pf.c`), `code_3i40_14bits` (`c3_14pf.c`), `code_4i40_17bits`
//! (`c4_17pf.c`), `code_8i40_31bits` (`c8_31pf.c`) and `code_10i40_35bits`
//! (`c1035pf.c`) with their searches, `build_code`s, `compress_code` and `q_p`,
//! the shared depth-first `search_10and8i40` (`s10_8pf.c`), and the dispatcher
//! `cbsearch` (`cbsearch.c`) including the pitch sharpening it applies itself
//! at 10.2 and 12.2 kbit/s.
//!
//! # What validated it
//!
//! `testdata/nb_enc_trace.txt`, produced by driving TS 26.073's own encoder at
//! **7.40 kbit/s** over `testdata/amrnb_enc_input.pcm`. The committed tests
//! drive [`search`] from the traced `xn2`, `h1` and `res` rows plus `T0` and a
//! sharpening factor reconstructed from the traced `gain_pit`, and compare the
//! resulting `code` and `y2` rows over three frames and twelve subframes. The
//! *chosen index* is checked separately, against the position and sign fields
//! of `testdata/amrnb_enc_mode4.amr` — the reference encoder's own bitstream —
//! because two different indices can build codevectors that score identically
//! and only the index says which one the reference picked.
//!
//! During development the same harness ran over all fifty frames (200
//! subframes) of `tools/trace-amrnb-encoder.sh`'s output at **every one of the
//! eight rates**, so every codebook here has been checked against the
//! reference. Only 7.40 kbit/s is covered by a test that ships, because only
//! that rate's trace is committed.
//!
//! # Why so much of this file is about tie-breaking
//!
//! Every stage maximises `ps²/alp` through the cross-multiplied difference
//! `alp_best·sq_cand − sq_best·alp_cand`, and accepts on **strictly greater
//! than zero** — never `>=`. An implementation that used `>=` would pick a
//! different-but-equally-good pulse on every exact tie, produce speech that
//! sounds identical, and fail conformance. The visit order therefore matters as
//! much as the objective, and each search states both.
//!
//! Three traps in particular survive a plausible-sounding implementation:
//!
//! - **The `sq = -1, alp = 1` sentinel does not force the first candidate in.**
//!   The test reduces to `sq1 + alp_16 > 0`, and `alp_16` can be negative
//!   because [`correlate_impulse`] folds the pulse signs into `rr`'s
//!   off-diagonal. A stage can genuinely finish with its index still at the
//!   reset value, and a whole sweep can finish with `codvec` still at its
//!   `codvec[i] = i` default.
//! - **`ps` resets to zero, not to the incoming `ps0`.** A stage that accepts
//!   nothing hands the next stage a zero correlation rather than the one it
//!   inherited.
//! - **The sign product in `rr` is `mult(sign_i, sign_j)`, which is `+32766`
//!   or `−32767`** — not `±1`. Positive and negative correlations are scaled
//!   by different factors, and collapsing them to a sign flip changes which
//!   candidate wins.
//!
//! # Q-formats
//!
//! `h` is Q12 and the target `xn2` is Q0. The correlation `dn` is normalised so
//! that the sum of the per-track maxima cannot saturate, and `rr` is normalised
//! against `h`'s own energy — neither carries a fixed Q. Codevectors come out
//! Q13 at every rate except 12.2 kbit/s, which is Q12; the filtered codevector
//! `y` is Q12.
