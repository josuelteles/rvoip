//! The AMR-NB encoder's gain quantisers, TS 26.090 §5.9.
//!
//! Implements, from the TS 26.073 fixed-point reference: `gainQuant` and the
//! `gainQuantState` lifecycle (`gain_q.c`), `Qua_gain` (`qua_gain.c`),
//! `q_gain_code` (`q_gain_c.c`) with `G_code` (`g_code.c`), `q_gain_pitch`
//! (`q_gain_p.c`), the whole 4.75 kbit/s two-subframe path —
//! `MR475_gain_quant`, `MR475_update_unq_pred` and `MR475_quant_store_results`
//! (`qgain475.c`) — the whole 7.95 kbit/s path — `MR795_gain_quant`,
//! `MR795_gain_code_quant3` and `MR795_gain_code_quant_mod` (`qgain795.c`)
//! with `gain_adapt` (`g_adapt.c`) and `gmed_n` (`gmed_n.c`) — and the energy
//! coefficients all of them consume, `calc_filt_energies`,
//! `calc_target_energy` and `calc_unfilt_energies` (`calc_en.c`).
//!
//! The MA energy predictor `gc_pred` is **not** reimplemented here: the
//! decoder's [`CodeGainPredictor`] is the same function and the same state, and
//! is used directly.
//!
//! # What validated it
//!
//! `testdata/nb_enc_trace.txt`, produced by driving TS 26.073's own encoder at
//! **7.40 kbit/s**. The committed tests drive [`GainQuantiser::quantise`] from
//! the traced `xn`, `xn2`, `y1`, `y2`, `res`, `adapt` and `code` rows and
//! compare `gain_pit` and `gain_code` over three frames and twelve subframes,
//! and compare the chosen VQ *index* against the gain field of
//! `testdata/amrnb_enc_mode4.amr` — the reference encoder's own bitstream —
//! because two table entries can dequantise to nearly the same gains and only
//! the index says which one the reference picked.
//!
//! During development the same harness ran over all fifty frames (200
//! subframes) at **every one of the eight rates**, including 4.75's joint
//! two-subframe index and 7.95's adaptive criterion. Only 7.40 kbit/s is
//! covered by a test that ships, because only that rate's trace is committed.
//!
//! # Five quantisers, not one
//!
//! | Rate | Quantiser | Index |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 4.75 | `MR475_gain_quant`, 256-entry joint VQ | one 8-bit word for **two** subframes |
//! | 5.15, 5.90 | `Qua_gain`, 64-entry joint VQ | 6 bits per subframe |
//! | 6.70, 7.40, 10.2 | `Qua_gain`, 128-entry joint VQ | 7 bits per subframe |
//! | 7.95 | `MR795_gain_quant`, scalar pitch + adapted scalar code | 4 + 5 bits |
//! | 12.2 | `G_code` then `q_gain_code`, 32-entry scalar | 5 bits (pitch gain is quantised earlier, in `cl_ltp`) |
//!
//! Only 7.95 and 12.2 ever call `q_gain_pitch`. Every other rate takes its
//! pitch gain straight from the joint VQ entry it selected, and scalar-
//! quantising it instead gives a `gain_pit` that is close, plausible, and not
//! the reference's.
//!
//! # Q-formats
//!
//! Pitch gains are Q14 and code gains Q1 throughout. The predicted code gain
//! travels as `(exponent Q0, fraction Q15)` and is raised to `gcode0` in Q14
//! by `Pow2(14, fraction)` — the exponent stays out of it and is folded into a
//! shift later, which is why the two never appear multiplied together.
//! Coefficients are normalised `(fraction Q15, exponent Q0)` pairs with no
//! fixed scale of their own.
