//! AMR-NB pitch analysis, encoder side — 3GPP TS 26.090 §5.5 and §5.6.
//!
//! Implements TS 26.073's `ol_ltp` (`ol_ltp.c`), `Pitch_ol` with its `Lag_max`
//! and `comp_corr` (`pitch_ol.c`, `calc_cor.c`), `Pitch_ol_wgh` with its own
//! weighted `Lag_max` and `gmed_n` (`p_ol_wgh.c`, `gmed_n.c`), `Pitch_fr` with
//! `Norm_Corr`, `searchFrac` and `getRange` (`pitch_fr.c`), `Interpol_3or6`
//! (`inter_36.c`), `Convolve` (`convolve.c`), `Enc_lag3`/`Enc_lag6`,
//! `G_pitch` (`g_pitch.c`), `q_gain_pitch`'s index search (`q_gain_p.c`), the
//! `cl_ltp` driver (`cl_ltp.c`), and the tone-stability tracker `check_lsp` /
//! `check_gp_clipping` / `update_gp_clipping` (`ton_stab.c`).
//!
//! # Three searches, three different tie-breaks
//!
//! This is the trap the module exists to avoid. All three searches produce
//! perfectly reasonable speech when broken, and only the transmitted index
//! reveals it:
//!
//! | search | comparison | walk | tie goes to |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | open-loop lag, per section ([`peak_lag`]) | `>=` | descending | the **smallest** lag |
//! | closed-loop integer lag ([`ClosedLoopPitch::search`]) | `>=` | ascending | the **largest** lag |
//! | closed-loop fraction ([`search_fraction`]) | `>` | ascending from the start point | the **lowest** fraction |
//!
//! The open loop's preference for short lags is *not* in its tie-break — it is
//! the 0.85 handicap [`arbitrate_sections`] applies to the incumbent, whose own
//! comparisons are strict and therefore keep the longer-lag candidate on a tie.
//!
//! # Scaling decisions that choose the answer
//!
//! Two frame-wide or window-wide scaling choices are taken once from a single
//! measurement and then applied throughout, and both change which candidate
//! wins:
//!
//! - [`open_loop_lag`] picks ×8, ×1 or ÷8 for the whole frame from the total
//!   energy, detecting overflow as `t0 == MAX_32` rather than through a flag.
//! - [`normalised_correlation`] picks ×1 or ÷4 for the whole delay window from
//!   the energy at the *shortest* delay only, and narrows each result with a
//!   saturating 16-bit extraction, after which every saturated delay compares
//!   equal and the `>=` tie-break hands the lag to the largest of them.
//!
//! For every rate but 12.2 the open loop's normalised correlation is taken with
//! `extract_l` — the **low** half-word, unsaturated — so it can come out
//! negative for a positive product. That is what the section arbitration
//! compares, and it is normative.
//!
//! # Validated by
//!
//! `testdata/nb_enc_trace.txt` (three frames at 7.40 kbit/s from TS 26.073's own
//! encoder) and the bitstream `testdata/amrnb_enc_mode4.amr` it produced:
//!
//! - [`convolve`] against `y1`, [`pitch_gain`] against `gain_pit_ol`, and
//!   [`update_target`] against `xn2`, for all twelve committed subframes;
//! - the whole closed-loop search — [`normalised_correlation`], the integer
//!   scan, [`search_fraction`] and its post-normalisation — against `T0` and
//!   `T0_frac` on the six delta-coded subframes, whose window follows from the
//!   previous subframe's lag and so needs no open-loop input;
//! - [`encode_lag_1_3`] against all twelve transmitted lag indices;
//! - [`encode_lag_1_3`]/[`encode_lag_1_6`] against the decoder's own
//!   [`super::super::lag`] over their entire code spaces.
//!
//! The open-loop search itself is **not** compared against the trace, and
//! cannot be: its input is the weighted speech `wsp`, which the instrumented
//! reference does not record, and the frame-level `T_op0` row it does emit is
//! written only on the 4.75/5.15 code path. It is covered here by hand-built
//! correlation vectors that pin each comparison and tie direction, by a planted
//! period, and — for the full-search subframes — by showing that some open-loop
//! lag reproduces the traced closed-loop result, uniquely so in frame 0.
