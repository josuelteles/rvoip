//! The AMR-NB decoder's time-domain back end: synthesis filtering, gain
//! control, phase dispersion and excitation control.
//!
//! Implements TS 26.073 `syn_filt.c` (`Syn_filt`), `agc.c` (`agc`, `agc2` and
//! their shared energy measure), `residu.c` (`Residu`), `weight_a.c`
//! (`Weight_Ai`), `preemph.c` (`preemphasis`), `ph_disp.c` (`ph_disp`,
//! `ph_disp_reset`, `ph_disp_lock`, `ph_disp_release`), `ex_ctrl.c` (`Ex_ctrl`)
//! and the 9-point median `gmed_n.c` that `Ex_ctrl` needs. The prose is
//! TS 26.090 §6.1 (short-term synthesis) and §6.2 (adaptive phase dispersion).
//!
//! Validated bit-exactly against the `synfilt`, `agc`, `agc2`, `weightai`,
//! `residu`, `preemph`, `phdisp` and `exctrl` sections of
//! `testdata/nb_stages.txt`, which `tools/amrnb_stage_oracle.c` produced by
//! driving the reference's own functions.
//!
//! # Q-formats
//!
//! Signals are Q0 throughout — the decoder works in integer sample units and
//! only the coefficients and gains carry a scale. LP coefficients are Q12 with
//! `a[0] == 4096`; expansion factors and the pre-emphasis and AGC coefficients
//! are Q15; the phase-dispersion impulse responses are Q15; codebook gain is
//! Q1 and LTP gain Q14. Each function restates this on its own doc.
//!
//! # `Syn_filt`'s overflow-retry contract
//!
//! [`synthesis_filter`] does not handle its own overflow. TS 26.073's
//! `dec_amr.c` wraps every decoder-side call in a retry that the caller must
//! reproduce, because the recovery touches the excitation *history*, which this
//! module does not own:
//!
//! 1. Clear [`DspContext::overflow`] **immediately** before the call. Anything
//!    the preceding phase dispersion, excitation control or `agc2` raised is
//!    deliberately discarded.
//! 2. Call [`synthesis_filter`] with the current memory, keeping the returned
//!    memory *unwritten* for now.
//! 3. If the flag is still clear, commit the returned memory and carry on.
//! 4. If it is set, right-shift the **entire** 194-sample excitation history by
//!    two — `PIT_MAX + L_INTERPOL + L_SUBFR`, which includes the current
//!    subframe — and the current subframe's excitation too, then call
//!    [`synthesis_filter`] again with the *unchanged* memory and commit its
//!    result. `mem_syn` is deliberately not rescaled: the retry filters a
//!    quartered excitation through an un-quartered memory.
//!
//! Two details of that retry read like bugs and are not. It always re-filters
//! the plain enhanced excitation, never the pitch-sharpened `excp` copy that
//! may have been used on the first attempt; and the retry is not itself
//! preceded by a clear, so an overflow *it* raises leaks into the next subframe
//! until that subframe's own step 1.
//!
//! # Which state persists
//!
//! [`AdaptiveGain`], [`Preemphasis`] and [`PhaseDispersion`] all carry state
//! across subframes *and* frames. The synthesis memory is returned rather than
//! stored so its owner can implement the retry above. See each type's docs for
//! its reset value — in particular [`AdaptiveGain`] resets to 1.0, not to zero.
