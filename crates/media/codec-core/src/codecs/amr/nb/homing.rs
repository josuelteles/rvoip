//! Homing frames for AMR-NB, TS 26.073 `e_homing.c` and `d_homing.c`.
//!
//! The narrowband counterpart of [`super::super::wb::homing`], and it is
//! considerably simpler than that one: the pattern is stored as *parameters*
//! and compared against the decoded parameters directly. No 15-bit repacking,
//! no left-aligned final word, and no masked fields — wideband's three
//! complications all come from its own table being stored in packed form.
//!
//! What homing is *for* is the same in both, and the wideband module's header
//! explains it: feed the encoder a frame of `0x0008` samples and it emits one
//! exact parameter pattern and resets; feed the decoder that pattern and it
//! emits `0x0008` and resets. Both ends then agree on their whole internal
//! state at a point the test sequence chooses. It is a protocol *around* the
//! codec, not a stage in it, and it lives outside `Decoder` here exactly as it
//! lives outside `Decoder_amr` in the reference.
