"""Insert trace points into scratch copies of TS 26.073's cod_amr.c and sp_enc.c.

The narrowband twin of `instrument-amrwb-encoder.py`, built for the same reason:
an encoder that makes the wrong *decision* still produces plausible speech at
the far end, so only a per-stage diff separates "different" from "wrong".

Narrowband adds a complication wideband does not have. At 4.75 kbit/s the
encoder codes two subframes jointly, which it implements by saving state,
running subframe 0, running subframe 1, and then *re-running* subframe 0's
post-processing with the jointly chosen gains. The trace therefore sees some
subframes twice, and the second pass is the one that counts. Anything comparing
against it has to expect that rather than assume one pass per subframe.

Not part of the reference; only ever applied to a scratch copy. Every insertion
asserts its anchor: a silently missing trace point reads as agreement.
