# Generate erased-frame fixtures and the reference PCM for them, both variants.
#
# Both decoders implement concealment and neither can be shown to run it: every
# committed fixture is a clean stream, so `FrameQuality::Good` is the only path
# a test has ever taken. Concealment is also where a decoder is least likely to
# be right by accident — it is pure state machine, it only runs when something
# has already gone wrong, and getting it wrong sounds like a bad network rather
# than like a bug.
#
# The storage format carries the frame quality in the ToC byte's bit 2 (RFC 4867
# §5.3, and `decoder.c`: `q = (toc >> 2) & 1`). Clearing it marks the frame
# SPEECH_BAD, which is exactly what an RTP receiver does when the payload's Q bit
# is zero — so the fixture is the real signal, not a simulation of one.
#
# The erasure pattern is deliberate rather than random:
#   frame 5        a single loss in a clean run
#   frames 10-12   a burst, so the erasure state machine climbs past one
#   frame 13       the first good frame after a burst, where both gain
#                  concealers limit against the last known-good value
#   frames 20,22   alternating, which keeps the machine oscillating instead of
#                  settling
#
