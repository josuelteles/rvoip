# Build an instrumented TS 26.173 encoder that dumps its per-subframe
# intermediates, for diffing against the Rust encoder's own trace.
#
# The decoder's six defects were all found this way and none of them by
# reasoning about output. An encoder is worse: it has to reproduce a *decision*
# as well as an arithmetic result, so a wrong codebook search still produces
# perfectly plausible speech at the far end. Diffing intermediates is the only
# instrument that distinguishes "different" from "wrong".
#
# Usage: trace-amrwb-encoder.sh [mode-index] [workdir]
