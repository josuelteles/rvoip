//! Bounded, one-source-to-many real-time media routing.
//!
//! A `MediaStream::frames_in()` receiver is intentionally single-take. The
//! media graph owns that receiver once and exposes dynamic sink routes so a
//! call peer, recorder, UCTP publisher, and MOQT publisher can observe the
//! same source without racing for frames.
//!
//! # Which codecs the graph carries
//!
//! PCMU, PCMA, G.729, Opus, and the internal `pcm_s16le`. Every codec entering
//! the graph is identified by a key derived from its *name*, via
//! [`crate::bridge::codec_to_pt`]; a name outside that table is refused with
//! [`RvoipError::UnsupportedCodec`] before any receiver ownership transfers.
//!
//! **AMR-NB and AMR-WB are not among them.** They are fully implemented in
//! `rvoip-codec-core` and carried end to end on the SIP media path, but they
//! cannot flow through this graph — so an AMR call cannot be published over
//! UCTP, recorded through the graph, or fanned out to MOQT. The boundary is
//! deliberate: AMR's payload type is negotiated per call and one session
//! routinely uses two of them at once, so a name-derived key cannot describe
//! it, and this graph stamps that key onto the frames it emits.
//!
//! The decision, its evidence, and the six things wiring AMR in would require
//! are recorded in `docs/MEDIA_GRAPH_CODECS.md`.
