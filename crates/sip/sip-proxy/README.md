Transaction-stateful SIP proxy primitives for
[rvoip](https://github.com/eisenzopf/rvoip). Provides the
`StatefulProxy`, target-set processing, response-context aggregation,
and Via handling consumed by the
[`rvoip-sip`](https://crates.io/crates/sip/rvoip-sip) umbrella API.

## Status

**Bounded RFC 3261 transaction-stateful proxy profile, updated by RFC 4320 and
RFC 6026.** The coordinated `0.3.8` candidate includes
transaction-stateful forwarding, parallel/sequential forking, Via and
Max-Forwards processing, response aggregation, CANCEL propagation, and
Timer C. The claim is limited to the behaviors and real-peer matrix named in
the conformance documents and becomes releasable only when the strict beta
gate passes.

The applicable normative behavior, known gaps, and executable evidence
required for a bounded claim are tracked in
[`docs/RFC3261_CONFORMANCE.md`](docs/RFC3261_CONFORMANCE.md). Baseline and
gate provenance are in
[`docs/CONFORMANCE_STATUS.md`](docs/CONFORMANCE_STATUS.md). A green unit
suite alone must not be represented as RFC conformance.

## Install

You usually don't depend on this directly — depend on
[`rvoip-sip`](https://crates.io/crates/sip/rvoip-sip) which re-exports the
proxy primitives behind its `server::*` and `adapter::*` modules. If
you want the raw transaction-layer primitives:

```toml
[dependencies]
rvoip-sip-proxy = "0.3.8"
```
