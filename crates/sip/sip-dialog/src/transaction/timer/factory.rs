//! Provides a factory for creating and scheduling standardized SIP timers.
//!
//! The [`TimerFactory`] simplifies the process of starting common RFC 3261 timers
//! (A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K) by using pre-configured [`TimerSettings`] and
//! interacting with a [`TimerManager`].
//!
//! # RFC 3261 Timer Requirements
//!
//! SIP transaction timers are crucial for ensuring reliable message delivery over unreliable
//! transports like UDP. RFC 3261 Section 17 defines different transaction types (INVITE client,
//! non-INVITE client, INVITE server, non-INVITE server) with different timer requirements.
//!
//! The `TimerFactory` abstracts these requirements, providing convenience methods for
//! starting the appropriate timers for each transaction type and state:
//!
//! - **INVITE Client Transactions**: Use Timers A, B, and D for retransmission,
//!   timeout, and wait time respectively
//! - **Non-INVITE Client Transactions**: Use Timers E, F, and K for similar purposes
//! - **INVITE Server Transactions**: Use Timers G, H, and I for response retransmission,
//!   ACK waiting, and cleanup
//! - **Non-INVITE Server Transactions**: Use Timer J for absorbing request retransmissions
//!
//! # Usage Example
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//! use std::time::Duration;
//! use rvoip_sip_dialog::transaction::timer::{TimerFactory, TimerManager, TimerSettings};
//! use rvoip_sip_dialog::transaction::TransactionKey;
//! use rvoip_sip_core::Method;
//!
//! # async fn example() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! // Create transaction keys for different transaction types
//! let invite_client_key = TransactionKey::new("z9hG4bK.123".to_string(), Method::Invite, false);
//! let register_client_key = TransactionKey::new("z9hG4bK.456".to_string(), Method::Register, false);
//! let invite_server_key = TransactionKey::new("z9hG4bK.789".to_string(), Method::Invite, true);
//!
//! // Create timer manager and factory with custom settings
//! let settings = TimerSettings {
//!     t1: Duration::from_millis(200), // Faster retransmissions for testing
//!     ..Default::default()
//! };
//! let timer_manager = Arc::new(TimerManager::new(Some(settings.clone())));
//! let factory = TimerFactory::new(Some(settings), timer_manager.clone());
//!
//! // Schedule INVITE client transaction initial timers (A and B)
//! factory.schedule_invite_client_initial_timers(invite_client_key.clone()).await?;
//!
//! // Schedule non-INVITE client transaction initial timers (E and F)
//! factory.schedule_non_invite_client_initial_timers(register_client_key.clone()).await?;
//!
//! // Schedule individual timers as needed
//! factory.schedule_timer_g(invite_server_key.clone()).await?;
//! factory.schedule_timer_h(invite_server_key.clone()).await?;
//!
//! // Later, cancel all timers for a terminated transaction
//! factory.cancel_all_timers(&invite_client_key).await?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
