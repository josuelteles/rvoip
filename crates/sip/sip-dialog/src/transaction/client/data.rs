/// # Client Transaction Data Structures
///
/// This module provides data structures and traits for implementing the client transaction
/// state machines defined in RFC 3261 Section 17.1.
///
/// Client transactions in SIP are responsible for:
/// - Reliably sending requests from the Transaction User (TU)
/// - Managing retransmissions over unreliable transports
/// - Receiving and routing responses back to the TU
/// - Maintaining transaction state according to RFC 3261
///
/// The key components in this module are:
/// - `ClientTransactionData`: Core data structure shared by all client transaction types
/// - `CommonClientTransaction`: Trait providing shared behavior across transaction types
/// - Command channels for communication with the transaction's event loop
