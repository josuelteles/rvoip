# Per-rate AMR interop sweep: one live PBX cell per codec mode.
#
# Every ordinary AMR cell runs at whichever mode the encoder opens at, which is
# the highest the negotiation permits. That leaves the other rates with
# conformance-vector evidence and no third-party evidence at all. This pins one
# rate per cell the standard way -- `Config::amr_mode_set` puts an RFC 4867
# `mode-set` in the INVITE naming exactly that mode, reached from here through
# `PBX_AMR_MODE_SET` -- and records what came back.
#
# Two facts are captured per cell, because the interesting failure passes the
# obvious check: a cell pinned to one rate and a cell that ignored the pin both
# carry clean audio, so "the call passed" attests to nothing about the rate.
#
#   built_mode_set  the mode the codec was *actually constructed with*, read
#                   from media-core's `codec generation built` log line rather
#                   than from the environment variable meant to cause it.
#   tone            the analyser's far-tone-over-near-tone dominance for the
#                   cell, so a pinned rate that produced silence cannot pass.
#
# A row is only meaningful when `built_mode_set` equals `mode`. The script
# fails if any row disagrees, so a sweep cannot quietly attest to the wrong
# rate.
#
# Usage:
#   rate-sweep.sh [--profile amrnb|amrwb] [--transport UDP|TLS]
#                 [--pbx asterisk|freeswitch] [--modes 0,1,2] [--out FILE]
#
# Defaults sweep every mode the variant has: 0-7 narrowband, 0-8 wideband.
